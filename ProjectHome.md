Scientific project for testing new large scale clustering/quantization algorithms. These algorithms are typically distributed and asynchronous. The code is written in C#/.NET (4.0) and runs on Microsoft Azure Platform. The project is built using Lokad.Cloud which provides an O/C (Object to Cloud) Mapper and an 'execution framework' that leverages low level technicalities of MS Azure.

This project follows theoretical work made by Patra that can be found in [Journal of Machine Learning Research 12 (2011) 3431-3466](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume12/patra11a/patra11a.pdf)

This project is also naturally linked to the first work of Durut and Rossi on Azure implementation of the popular batch KMeans algorithm
